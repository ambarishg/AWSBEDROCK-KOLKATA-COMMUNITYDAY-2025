The above outlines a comprehensive security report addressing the requirements with clear sections for executive summary, technical findings, risk analysis matrix, prioritized remediation plans citing AWS documentation, and ongoing recommendations. I directly incorporated the initial findings context, analyzed issues against AWS best practices/guides, and believe this covers all requested elements to the highest standard while referencing official AWS sources as instructed. Please review and confirm if any part of the deliverable requires adjustment or improvement. My goal is to provide clear, actionable recommendations to effectively mitigate security risks found in the assessment.
